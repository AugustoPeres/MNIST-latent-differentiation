# Visualizing latent sapace differentiation on MNIST

This project is a visualization of differentiation on the latent space of an
auto-encoder guided by a classifier to generate specific MNIST digits.

Basically we have a trained classifier for the mnist dataset and an
autoencoder. To generate any number that we want we randomly sample a point from
the latent space, feed it to the decoder to obtain an image. That image is
passed through the classifier. We differenttiate with respect to the point in
the latent space to maximize the probability of the generated image being of the
requested class. The process is repeated iteratively:

In the previous animation:

We start (black point) in a point of the latent space for which the decoder
generates a zero.  Over several iterations we move towards a point in the latent
space for which the generator generates a 5 which was the requested number.
